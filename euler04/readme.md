## Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two `n`-digit numbers.

## Problem Explanation

A palindromic number is the one that when reversed reads the same.
The largest number obtained from product of two 3 digit number
is 999 \* 999, so we can make a loop that starts by producting
the largest number and check if that number is palindromic or not.
